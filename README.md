## Future Ideas 

- Have only the recipe title, image and 'see full recipe' display on the home page. The button would take them to a new page with instructrions/ingredients.
- Users would be able to favorite recipes and rate them.
- Add a cocktail or mocktail to be paired with the vegetarian recipe. 
- Add landing message to body of the home page.
